# MusicCode
hypothetical os project for lab 4 in Open Source Software


A software (or library) called MusicCode (Super creative, I know) that simplifies the transitions and interactions between code and sheet music. Improves filetypes, inputs and offers many tools/functions to build code around and for higher level music software. 
The buisness model would be to have the software engineers and experts in house and then loan them out to other software companies that might want to use the tools. They would pay for the experts and thus would only have to worry about the higher level and the tools just working. 
The License I would choose would be MIT license. While our experts would work directly on the code, this license would allow others to add specific features they are dying to have used or installed. This would also allow for high level software to use the project and distribute it without any legal nightmares.
